# Safecast bGeigie nano mount

This simple suction cup mounting attachment is designed to keep a [Safecast](http://blog.safecast.org/) [bGeigie nano](http://blog.safecast.org/) Geiger counter logger securely mounted on the car while driving at higher speeds. If simply hung out of the window, the unit starts flapping, but suction cups keep it secure.

Mounting plate can be easily cut from wood or plastic with a laser or milled with a CNC router. Commonly available suction cups with M4 threads (check ebay, amazon) can be attached with some 3D printed spacers to the plate. Size of the spacers matters if you wish to mount the unit on the inside of the car window or the outside. Spacers in the STL files are designed for 6mm mounting plate thickness, you can adjust this parameter in OpenSCAD and generate spacers as needed.

Attach the bottom of the bGeigie with two zip-ties to the mounting plate and run the strap through the top of the bGeigie and loop it around the door with the car window opened. Now you can tilt the bGeigie from the plate to open it and turn it on. Then close it and press the suction cups to glass, close the window and tighten the strap. Your bGeigie is securely mounted now and you can safely drive at higher speeds. Note that some buzzing noise may occur due to air passing across the setup.
